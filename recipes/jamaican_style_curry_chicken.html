            <h3>Description</h3>
            <b>Wondering how to make curry chicken? This is the recipe that I put together from visiting various websites, verbal consultations, and just experimenting on my own and with my family. It's rich and hearty, with flavor that's great when you can't get the real thing in the islands. Try a variety of hot peppers to change the flavor — even sweet bell peppers give it a different taste. Use fresh thyme to really bring out the fresh taste.</b>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1 tomato, chopped</li>
                <li>2 slices habanero pepper (Optional)</li>
                <li>1 garlic clove, chopped</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons Jamaican-style curry powder</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground thyme</li>
                <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, tomato, habanero pepper, garlic, curry powder, and thyme and cook, stirring, until onion is golden, about 7 minutes</li>
                <li>Stir in chicken and cook until chicken is lightly browned, about 5 minutes</li>
                <li>Pour water into the skillet. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink at the center, about 30 minutes. Season with salt</li>
