        <li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 (6 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>¾ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 small bunch fresh basil, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking dish</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking water</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook onion in oil until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds. Stir in tomato sauce and tomato paste and cook until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Add cream and Parmesan cheese. Season with sugar, salt, and pepper</li>
        <li>Stir some of the reserved pasta water into sauce and add cooked penne. Remove from the heat and stir in cherry tomatoes, 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese, and basil. Add more pasta water if needed to reach desired consistency. Pour penne mixture into the prepared baking dish and cover with remaining mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and cheese is melted, about 20 minutes</li>
    </ol>
